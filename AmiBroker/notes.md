## Real-Time Data Issue
One of the main challenges right now is getting real-time data fed into AmiBorker.

### AmiBroker Docs:
[How to work with Real-Time data plugins](https://www.amibroker.com/guide/h_rtsource.html)
[Working with real time quote window](https://www.amibroker.com/guide/w_rtquote.html)

### Solutions
The AmiBroker team recommends IQFeed as a data broker. They appear to have a relatively deep partnership with IQFeed, based on this page from the AmiBroker site.
