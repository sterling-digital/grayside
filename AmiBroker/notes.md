## Real-Time Data Issue
One of the main challenges right now is getting real-time data fed into AmiBorker.

### AmiBroker Reference Docs:
1. [How to work with Real-Time data plugins](https://www.amibroker.com/guide/h_rtsource.html)
2. [Working with real time quote window](https://www.amibroker.com/guide/w_rtquote.html)
3. [How to get quotes from various markets](https://www.amibroker.com/guide/h_quotes.html)

### Solutions
[Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/pricing) may be a good option. They are $200/mo for real-time data.
